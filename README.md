# Healthcare-Dataset-Analysis

This project will analyze the healthcare insurance dataset across 38 states in the country. There are six dataset sources, these are; 1.BenefitsCostSharing.csv 2.BusinessRules.csv 3.Network.csv 4.PlanAttributes.csv 5.Rate.csv 6.ServiceArea.csv The set of seven public use files containing information on health insurance issuers participating in the Health Insurance Marketplace and certified qualified health plans (QHPs) offered on HealthCare.gov. Plan information incudes details about essential health benefits, cost sharing, rates, and geographic coverage.

The datasets used in this report contain data on health and dental plans offered to individuals and small businesses through the US Health Insurance Marketplace. This data was originally prepared and released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In this report we try to find some useful information to support the CMS work.

The main business question this project will address is predicting the health Plan that will be a dental or full health plan. Lets start our analysis with BenefitsCostSharing.csv dataset to answer How do plan rates and benefits vary across states?
